# **Introuduction**

There are few topics in Machine Learning that make people go "Wow, that's neat!". Text generation is one such concept, wich manages to enchant almost everyone universally. In this project, I implement and evaluate the performance of 3 models (Markov Chain, LSTM and GRU) for the same.

The dataset I have used comes from webscraping the NPTEL Website for the list of all the unique courses they offer. The URL I scraped the data from can be found [here](https://nptel.ac.in/noc/noc_courselist.html).


# **Models Used**
- Markov Chain (with Byte-Pair Encodings)
- LSTM
- GRU

# **Generated Titles**

Based off of our three models, here are a couple of plausible courses that were generated:

Markov Chain:
  - development proces and pe build
  - centric shell programs

LSTM:
  - introduction to power systems biometallic concep
  - basics of management analysis and perspective 
  - on systems application systems in engineering

GRU:
  - introduction to learning and analytics for estami
  - for statistics of materials biointroduction
  - management security devices thermodynamics math
